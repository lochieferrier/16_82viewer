Changenotes:
- I've gone through and changed any spaces you've had in the strings used for indexing, the variable names, into hyphens. This eliminates
the nasty varDict["S_Mission, Aircraft, Wing"] syntax.
- Usually lambda = chord_tip/chord_root (taper ratio) I think it was just getting inverted here so I inverted it back.
- I'm keeping all the geometry in the same units, so having the tail boom diameter in inches makes it look super fat.
Threw in the conversion, but it's probably best to output everything the same on your side.
- I don't know what eta refers to, and it's only used in the pi-tail, so I threw it out.
- What's useful to you in terms of camera positioning I'm not super sure about. Let me know if you want further control in
this area, you can see how the camera is initially positioned in createScene().
- The camera controls should make more sense now, pan is silly so I got rid of it, the whole thing rotates around C.G.
- That vertical stabilizer is bad on your end I'm pretty sure. It shouldn't have half the span of the horizontal but almost twice the area.
- Now using "ellipse" shapes (I don't think that's what they're called) for the front and end caps. You set a radius (in this case
equal to the fuselage radius), and a length.

I think what was also causing you confusion was the fact that the dummyDict was also present,
as getDummyDict() was being called. I've commented that out, now only the data from the CSV
is being included.

Overall, bad communication on my part, I'm sorry about this, let me know if you need more help or further mods.

Live reloading:
The way I did this was to set up a simple python server to serve the csv file,
and use an AJAX request on the browser side to continually check for updates.

If the browser spots a change in the file, it redraws the rendering. Checks every
500 ms, you can probably make it faster, given that it's a local filesystem.

Process for using live reloading:
- Run pyserver.py
- Click the button that says "Start live reload"
- Save changes to the csv file you specify at the top of vis.js, and the changes
should show up in the sketch
