Changenotes:
- I've gone through and changed any spaces you've had in the strings used for indexing, the variable names, into hyphens. This eliminates
the nasty varDict["S_Mission, Aircraft, Wing"] syntax.
- Usually lambda = chord_tip/chord_root (taper ratio) I think it was just getting inverted here so I inverted it back.
- I'm keeping all the geometry in the same units, so having the tail boom diameter in inches makes it look super fat.
Threw in the conversion, but it's probably best to output everything the same on your side.
- I don't know what eta refers to, and it's only used in the pi-tail, so I threw it out.
- The vertical stabilizers had massive chord, which I think was because you meant the area for both verts,
not individually. I divided by 2 to correct this, they look okay (still a little fat) now.

I think what was also causing you confusion was the fact that the dummyDict was also present,
as getDummyDict() was being called. I've commented that out, now only the data from the CSV
is being included.


Overall, bad communication on my part, I'm sorry about this, let me know if you need more help or further mods.
